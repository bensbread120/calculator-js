This is a basic js calculator, designed to show a comprehensive understanding of js functions, DOM manipulation and an over all understanding of the front end.

The calculator should work entirely from the webpage and be able to multiply, divide, add and subtract.

The clear button should wipe all variables

The equals buttons will display the result

More than one expression should be able to be strung together, however the expression will be evaluated from left to right rather than traditional BODMAS.
ie 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42.
